The only way we had was sign language. That’s how we usually communicate with our dog at home, right? When we tell him, “We love you, Jimmy,” he responds by wagging his tail. This doesn’t mean he knows what we are actually saying. Instead, his response is simply because he understands the language of emotions and gestures more than words.</p><p name="ff39" id="ff39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We as humans have developed an understanding of a lot of nuances of the natural language more than any animal on this planet. That is why when we say “I LOVE you, honey” vs when we say “Lets make LOVE, honey” we mean different things. Since we understand the basic difference between the two phrases, our responses are very different. It is these very intricacies in natural language understanding that we want to teach to a machine.</p><p name="3683" id="3683" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What this could mean is when your future robot dog hears “I love you, Jimmy”, he would know LOVE is a Verb. He would also realize that it’s an emotion that we are expressing to which he would respond in a certain way. And maybe when you are telling your partner “Lets make LOVE”, the dog would just stay out of your business 😛.</p><p name="2a13" id="2a13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is just an example of how teaching a robot to communicate in a language known to us can make things easier.</p><p name="8ca4" id="8ca4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The primary use case being highlighted in this example is how important it is to understand the difference in the usage of the word LOVE, in different contexts.</p><h3 name="1ef3" id="1ef3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Part-of-Speech Tagging</h3><p name="4395" id="4395" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">From a very small age, we have been made accustomed to identifying part of speech tags. For example, reading a sentence and being able to identify what words act as nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, and so on. All these are referred to as the part of speech tags.</p><p name="3419" id="3419" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s look at the Wikipedia definition for them:</p><blockquote name="8576" id="8576" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">In corpus linguistics, <strong class="markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong">part-of-speech tagging</strong> (<strong class="markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong">POS tagging</strong> or <strong class="markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong">PoS tagging</strong> or <strong class="markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong">POST</strong>), also called <strong class="markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong">grammatical tagging</strong> or <strong class="markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong">word-category disambiguation</strong>, is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context — i.e., its relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase, sentence, or paragraph. A simplified form of this is commonly taught to school-age children, in the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.</blockquote><p name="43d8" id="43d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Identifying part of speech tags is much more complicated than simply mapping words to their part of speech tags. This is because POS tagging is not something that is generic. It is quite possible for a single word to have a different part of speech tag in different sentences based on different contexts. That is why it is impossible to have a generic mapping for POS tags.</p><p name="8248" id="8248" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As you can see, it is not possible to manually find out different part-of-speech tags for a given corpus. New types of contexts and new words keep coming up in dictionaries in various languages, and manual POS tagging is not scalable in itself. That is why we rely on machine-based POS tagging.</p><p name="891d" id="891d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before proceeding further and looking at how part-of-speech tagging is done, we should look at why POS tagging is necessary and where it can be used.</p><h3 name="1ef5" id="1ef5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why Part-of-Speech tagging?</h3><p name="40eb" id="40eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Part-of-Speech tagging in itself may not be the solution to any particular NLP problem. It is however something that is done as a pre-requisite to simplify a lot of different problems. Let us consider a few applications of POS tagging in various NLP tasks.</p><h4 name="de24" id="de24" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Text to Speech Conversion</h4><p name="7bf1" id="7bf1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Let us look at the following sentence:</p><pre name="e606" id="e606" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">They refuse to permit us to obtain the refuse permit.</pre><p name="c21f" id="c21f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">The word <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">refuse</code> is being used twice in this sentence and has two different meanings here. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">refUSE (/</em>rəˈfyo͞oz/)is a verb meaning “deny,” while <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">REFuse(/</em>ˈrefˌyo͞os/) is a noun meaning “trash” (that is, they are not homophones). Thus, we need to know which word is being used in order to pronounce the text correctly. (For this reason, text-to-speech systems usually perform POS-tagging.)</p><p name="47f9" id="47f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Have a look at the part-of-speech tags generated for this very sentence by the <a href="https://www.nltk.org/" data-href="https://www.nltk.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NLTK</a> package.</p><pre name="314e" id="314e" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">&gt;&gt;&gt; text = word_tokenize(&quot;They refuse to permit us to obtain the refuse permit&quot;)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; nltk.pos_tag(text)<br>[(&#39;They&#39;, &#39;PRP&#39;), (<strong class="markup--strong markup--pre-strong">&#39;refuse&#39;, &#39;VBP&#39;</strong>), (&#39;to&#39;, &#39;TO&#39;), (&#39;permit&#39;, &#39;VB&#39;), (&#39;us&#39;, &#39;PRP&#39;),<br>(&#39;to&#39;, &#39;TO&#39;), (&#39;obtain&#39;, &#39;VB&#39;), (&#39;the&#39;, &#39;DT&#39;), (<strong class="markup--strong markup--pre-strong">&#39;refuse&#39;, &#39;NN&#39;</strong>), (&#39;permit&#39;, &#39;NN&#39;)]</pre><p name="c7d6" id="c7d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">As we can see from the results provided by the NLTK package, POS tags for both <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">refUSE and REFuse </em>are different. Using these two different POS tags for our text to speech converter can come up with a different set of sounds.</p><p name="b0d3" id="b0d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Similarly, let us look at yet another classical application of POS tagging: word sense disambiguation.</p><h4 name="a7e6" id="a7e6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Word Sense Disambiguation</h4><p name="6e57" id="6e57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Let’s talk about this kid called Peter. Since his mother is a neurological scientist, she didn’t send him to school. His life was devoid of science and math.</p><p name="93e3" id="93e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One day she conducted an experiment, and made him sit for a math class. Even though he didn’t have any prior subject knowledge, Peter thought he aced his first test. His mother then took an example from the test and published it as below. (Kudos to her!)</p><figure name="16f8" id="16f8" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 763px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 108.89999999999999%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*nHkemiTJp9FJV-wjxBlGrA.png" data-width="1164" data-height="1268" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nHkemiTJp9FJV-wjxBlGrA.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Word-sense Disambiguation example — My son Peter’s first Maths problem.</figcaption></figure><p name="d744" id="d744" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Words often occur in different senses as different parts of speech. For example:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="9430" id="9430" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">She saw a <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">bear.</strong></li><li name="e92a" id="e92a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Your efforts will <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">bear</strong> fruit.</li></ul><p name="a38d" id="a38d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The word <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">bear </strong>in the above sentences has completely different senses, but more importantly one is a noun and other is a verb. Rudimentary word sense disambiguation is possible if you can tag words with their POS tags.</p><p name="4e2f" id="4e2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Word-sense disambiguation (WSD) is identifying which sense of a word (that is, which meaning) is used in a sentence, when the word has multiple meanings.</p><p name="c491" id="c491" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Try to think of the multiple meanings for this sentence:</p><p name="dbe2" id="dbe2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Time flies like an arrow</strong></p><p name="1614" id="1614" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here are the various interpretations of the given sentence. The meaning and hence the part-of-speech might vary for each word.</p><figure name="6f87" id="6f87" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 638px; max-height: 479px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*rOL82uvp5WPXtlhnFZEHKA.jpeg" data-width="638" data-height="479" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rOL82uvp5WPXtlhnFZEHKA.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Part-of-speech tags define the meaning of a sentence based on the context</figcaption></figure><p name="9b46" id="9b46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As we can clearly see, there are multiple interpretations possible for the given sentence. Different interpretations yield different kinds of part of speech tags for the words.This information, if available to us, can help us find out the exact version / interpretation of the sentence and then we can proceed from there.</p><p name="aae5" id="aae5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The above example shows us that a single sentence can have three different POS tag sequences assigned to it that are equally likely. That means that it is very important to know what specific meaning is being conveyed by the given sentence whenever it’s appearing. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">This is word sense disambiguation, as we are trying to find out THE sequence.</strong></p><p name="72fe" id="72fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These are just two of the numerous applications where we would require POS tagging. There are other applications as well which require POS tagging, like Question Answering, Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, and so on.</p><p name="1977" id="1977" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now that we have a basic knowledge of different applications of POS tagging, let us look at how we can go about actually assigning POS tags to all the words in our corpus.</p><h3 name="307d" id="307d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Types of POS taggers</h3><p name="5e20" id="5e20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">POS-tagging algorithms fall into two distinctive groups:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="3b0e" id="3b0e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Rule-Based POS Taggers</strong></li><li name="3539" id="3539" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Stochastic POS Taggers</strong></li></ul><p name="3f46" id="3f46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brill_tagger" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brill_tagger" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Brill tagger" rel="noopener" target="_blank">E. Brill’s tagger</a>, one of the first and most widely used English POS-taggers, employs rule-based algorithms. Let us first look at a very brief overview of what rule-based tagging is all about.</p><h4 name="bceb" id="bceb" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Rule-Based Tagging</h4><p name="fb8f" id="fb8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Automatic part of speech tagging is an area of natural language processing where statistical techniques have been more successful than rule-based methods.</p><p name="2832" id="2832" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Typical rule-based approaches use contextual information to assign tags to unknown or ambiguous words. Disambiguation is done by analyzing the linguistic features of the word, its preceding word, its following word, and other aspects.</p><p name="2868" id="2868" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, if the preceding word is an article, then the word in question must be a noun. This information is coded in the form of rules.</p><p name="3aa7" id="3aa7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Example of a rule:</p><blockquote name="c07b" id="c07b" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">If an ambiguous/unknown word X is preceded by a determiner and followed by a noun, tag it as an adjective.</blockquote><p name="4a5d" id="4a5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Defining a set of rules manually is an extremely cumbersome process and is not scalable at all. So we need some automatic way of doing this.</p><p name="5476" id="5476" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Brill’s tagger is a rule-based tagger that goes through the training data and finds out the set of tagging rules that best define the data and minimize POS tagging errors. The most important point to note here about Brill’s tagger is that the rules are not hand-crafted, but are instead found out using the corpus provided. The only feature engineering required is a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">set of rule templates </strong>that the model can use to come up with new features.</p><p name="6279" id="6279" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s move ahead now and look at Stochastic POS tagging.</p><h4 name="6e3a" id="6e3a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Stochastic Part-of-Speech Tagging</h4><p name="4d62" id="4d62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The term ‘stochastic tagger’ can refer to any number of different approaches to the problem of POS tagging. Any model which somehow incorporates frequency or probability may be properly labelled stochastic.</p><p name="488f" id="488f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The simplest stochastic taggers disambiguate words based solely on the probability that a word occurs with a particular tag. In other words, the tag encountered most frequently in the training set with the word is the one assigned to an ambiguous instance of that word. The problem with this approach is that while it may yield a valid tag for a given word, it can also yield inadmissible sequences of tags.</p><p name="2beb" id="2beb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An alternative to the word frequency approach is to calculate the probability of a given sequence of tags occurring. This is sometimes referred to as the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">n-gram</em> approach, referring to the fact that the best tag for a given word is determined by the probability that it occurs with the n previous tags. This approach makes much more sense than the one defined before, because it considers the tags for individual words based on context.</p><p name="1208" id="1208" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The next level of complexity that can be introduced into a stochastic tagger combines the previous two approaches, using both tag sequence probabilities and word frequency measurements. This is known as the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Hidden Markov Model (HMM)</strong>.</p><p name="cb43" id="cb43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before proceeding with what is a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Hidden<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em></strong>Markov Model, let us first look at what is a Markov Model. That will better help understand the meaning of the term <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Hidden<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em></strong>in HMMs.</p><h4 name="73b6" id="73b6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Markov Model</h4><p name="f813" id="f813" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Say that there are only three kinds of weather conditions, namely</p><ul class="postList"><li name="518b" id="518b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Rainy</li><li name="a5ed" id="a5ed" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Sunny</li><li name="5fe7" id="5fe7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Cloudy</li></ul><p name="11f0" id="11f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Now, since our young friend we introduced above, Peter, is a small kid, he loves to play outside. He loves it when the weather is sunny, because all his friends come out to play in the sunny conditions.</p><p name="5f95" id="5f95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He hates the rainy weather for obvious reasons.</p><p name="90fa" id="90fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every day, his mother observe the weather in the morning (that is when he usually goes out to play) and like always, Peter comes up to her right after getting up and asks her to tell him what the weather is going to be like. Since she is a responsible parent, she want to answer that question as accurately as possible.

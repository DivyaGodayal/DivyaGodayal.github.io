<h1>Hello,</h1>
<h2 class="sub-header">I'm Divya. A full-stack developer.</h2>
<p><b>
    My Moto: Research, Design, Develop.
</b></p>

<p>
    They are adorable, aren't they?
</p>
<p>
    And they teach us some very important software development lessons.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Research:</b> When you start a project you should keep your eyes wide open and research about the idea. Getting to know what your audience wants is important. You can't just act blind.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Design:</b> Every step is crucial in software development. If you skip design and just start developing you might end up with a software which is not robust and flexible. Design is like coming up with a blueprint for the house before actually building it. Be open to ideas from people around, especially your team members.  
</p>
<p>
    <b>Develop:</b> When you are developing the product specially when you are part of a team, you need to be vocal. Communication is key for developing a good product. 
</p>
<p>
    I am currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. Since joining USC, I have greatly enhanced my programming skills by taking up the course on Algorithms and also by building some amazing bots as a part of the course on Artificial Intelligence. I have also worked on diversifying my knowledge and skill set by taking up the course on Natural Language Processing and loved every bit of developing projects like a Part of Speech tagger and a Perceptron Classifier. 
</p>

<p>
    Currently, I am doing a summer internship at PhaseSpec in collaboration with the AMI institute of USC. The company has developed and advanced a new approach to the analysis of hyper spectral imagery. As an intern, I have been developing the iOS version of the application that does analysis on spectral data and then presents it to the user using Plotly density graphs and image segmentation.  Before interning at PhaseSpec, I was also one of the graders for the undergraduate level course on Data Structures and Object Oriented Design. 
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, I have almost 6 years of professional application development experience. During this time, I have programmed in many languages like  Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, C# and Swift and worked on a vast array of projects and teams. Most recently,  I led a team of developers at Kiota Labs to implement an end to end food delivery platform. My stint at Infosys helped me gain valuable experience in system design and full stack development. At Bitcot Inc. I was solely responsible for designing, developing and shipping the Do Not Disturb iOS application. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Short-term goal:</b> I am looking for full time opportunities which allow me to apply my experience and provide an environment for me to learn; I have a diverse profile and am open to pick up new technologies.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Long-term goal:</b> Make technology more accessible, especially to women. I believe technology can be a game changer if it is accessible to all, and can help solve some of the deep-rooted problems we are facing. By bringing more women in touch with technology, there is a higher probability of them taking to it. I believe I am in a position to make difference in this area, and I intend to capitalize on it.
</p>

<p>
    All-time goal: Keep learning, always!
</p>

<p>
    PS: When I am not coding or honing my technical skills, I love writing technical articles for <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">@freeCodeCamp.</a> 
</p>

<p>
    Did I tell you I sing and love to write poetry as well? Do check that out on <a href="https://medium.com/@divyagodayal" target="_blank">Medium</a> and <a href="https://www.smule.com/__DivyaGodayal__" target="_blank">Smule.</a>

                       As part of the Applied NLP's coursework @USC, I implemented a Vanilla and an Averaged Perceptron to classify hotel reviews. The dataset for this project was the same as that of Naive Bayes Classifier. The Averaged perceptron gave a test set F1 score of 0.93
